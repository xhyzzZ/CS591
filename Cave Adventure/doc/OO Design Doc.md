# CS591 OO Design Document
The java program has seven classes and one main function.
* [Actions classes](#Actions-classes)
* [Adventures classes](#Adventures-classes)
* [Monsters classes](#Monsters-classes)
* [Treasures classes](#Treasures-classes)
* [Random classes](#Random-classes)
* [Penances classes](#Penances-classes)
* [Helperfunctions classes](#Helperfunctions-classes)

## Actions classes
This class defines actions what should you do when you enter into new place(accessor method). For example,
- Object composition:
```
private String cleanCobWebs;  // first action

```
- struct method:
```
public Actions() {
    this.cleanCobWebs = "clean up all the cob webs";  //initialize object
}
```
- accessor method:
```
public String getCleanCobWebs() {
    return cleanCobWebs;      // get the first action
}
```
When you have met this question:
```
You have ventured deeper into the cave, what would you like to do?
  1) Attack the evil wombat and turn off the goblinâ€™s water supply 
  2) Pick up the golden shield
```
Option one is one of the functions defined in actions class called getCleanCobWebs( ).
